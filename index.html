        Yep, you read it. Bloody killers!</strong>

                    <h3 class="text-left">|| Some mindblowing facts about them:</h3>
                    <p>Despite their name, mantis shrimp aren’t shrimp at all. (Neither, of course, are they mantises.) They're <i>Stomatopods</i>, distant relatives to crabs, shrimp, and lobsters.
                        <strong>They are older than dinosaurs. </strong> Stomatopods began evolving independently from other crustaceans nearly 400 million years ago, about 170 million years before the first dinosaurs appeared on the scene. Mantis shrimp come in a variety of species, and we’re aware of about 400 of them. They’re usually classified by murder method Called "sea locusts" by ancient Assyrians, "prawn killers" in Australia, and now sometimes referred to as "thumb splitters" – because of the animal's ability to inflict painful gashes. Mantis shrimps sport powerful claws that are used to attack and kill prey by spearing, stunning, or dismembering. In captivity, some larger species can break through aquarium glass with a single strike.

                        <strong>Dactyl clubs superpowers.</strong> They uses those two appendages called dactyl clubs to pummel its prey, these weapons are employed with blinding quickness, they strike so rapidly, that generate vapor-filled bubbles in the water. The collapse of these bubbles produces measurable forces on their prey in addition to the instantaneous forces of 1,500 newtons that are caused by the impact of the appendage against the striking surface, which means that the prey is hit twice by a single strike; Even if the initial strike misses the prey, the shock wave could be enough powerfull to stun or even kill. These "fists" spring from their bodies at 50 mph, accelerating quicker than a .22-caliber bullet!!. At those speeds, the water surrounding them boil, to briefly reaches the temperature of the Sun’s surface. Furthermore, the impact can also produce sonoluminescence, this will produce a very small amount of light within the collapsing bubble, although the light is too weak and short-lived to be detected without advanced scientific equipment. The light emission probably has no biological significance but is rather a side-effect of the rapid snapping motion.

                        <strong>Crystal shild.</strong> You are now probably wondering...How can the animal deliver such a deadly blow without injuring itself? They found that the Stomatopods consisted of an outer coating of hydroxyapatite, a hard crystalline calcium-phosphate ceramic material. Beneath the surface lies the key to the animal’s anti-fracturing qualities. Layers of elastic polysaccharide chitin underlying the shell are positioned in a way to act as shock absorbers, reducing the possibility of cracks. The design is so effective that researchers modeled a new type of carbon fiber material after it with potential applications in aircraft panels and military body armor.
